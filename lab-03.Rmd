### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
```

```{r load-data, message=FALSE}
nobel <- read_csv("data/nobel.csv")
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

There are 935 observations in the dataset. The number of variables in the dataset is 26. Each row represents one Nobel laureate. 


```{r viewdata}
View(nobel)
```

### Exercise 2

    Create a new data frame called nobel_living that filters for:
    -laureates for whom country is available
    -laureates who are people as opposed to organizations (organizations are denoted with "org" as their gender)
    -laureates who are still alive (their died_date is NA)

     Confirm that once you have filtered for these characteristics you are left with a data frame with 228 observations, once again using inline code.
     
     **JTB Note: In order to see the actual 228x26 tibble, I've entered the code without the dataframe command (myDataframe <-) immediately below. Then, below that, I've entered the code with the dataframe command. 

```{r newdataframe1}
nobel %>%
  filter(!is.na(country),
  gender != "org",
  is.na(died_date))
```

```{r newdataframe2}
myDataframe <- nobel %>%
  filter(!is.na(country),
  gender != "org",
  is.na(died_date))
```

### Exercise 3

Remove this text, and add your answer for Exercise 1 here.
Add code chunks as needed.
Don't forget to label your code chunk.
Do not use spaces in code chunk labels.

### Exercise 4

Create a new variable called born_country_us that has the value "USA" if the laureate is born in the US, and "Other" otherwise. How many of the winners are born in the US?

### Exercise 5

Add a second variable to your visualization from Exercise 3 based on whether the laureate was born in the US or not. Based on your visualization, do the data appear to support Buzzfeedâ€™s claim? Explain your reasoning in 1-2 sentences.

    Your final visualization should contain a facet for each category.
    Within each facet, there should be a bar for whether the laureate won the award in the US or not.
    Each bar should have segments for whether the laureate was born in the US or not.


### Exercise 6

In a single pipeline, filter for laureates who won their prize in the US, but were born outside of the US, and then create a frequency table (with the count() function) for their birth country (born_country) and arrange the resulting data frame in descending order of number of observations for each country. Which country is the most common?
